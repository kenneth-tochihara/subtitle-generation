BUT THAT’S A CHALLENGE I’VE OUTGROWN--HOW MANY YACHTS CAN ONE MAN OWN?
SOME SAY THAT I’M A POMPOUS CREEP. SOMEHOW I DON’T LOSE THAT MUCH SLEEP.
WHY BOTHER WITH FALSE MODESTY?
HARVARD'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR ME.
EMMET/STUDENTS:  PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. GOOD TO KNOW.
EMMET: WELCOME TO HARVARD.
PADAMADAN: WASSUP.
ENID: YO.
PADAMADAN: Sundeep Agrawal Padamadan. But you may call me “Your Majesty.”
IN MY COUNTRY MY WORD WAS LAW, BUT THEN I FLEE
BECAUSE OF STUPID COUP D’ETAT. BUT HERE, I LEARNED.
I MADE NEW FRIENDS. AND SOON, RETURN
IN BULLETPROOF MERCEDES BENZ.
EMMET/STUDENTS: PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.  GOOD TO KNOW.
EMMET: WELCOME TO H—
ENID: Enid Hoopes.
I DID THE PEACE CORPS OVERSEAS, INOCULATING REFUGEES
IN FAMILY CLINICS THAT I BUILT MYSELF FROM MUD AND TREES.
I FOUGHT TO CLEAN UP THEIR LAGOONS AND SAVE THEIR RARE ENDANGERED LOONS
THEN LED A PROTEST MARCH AGAINST INSENSITIVE CARTOONS.
EMMET/STUDENTS: PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.  GOOD—
ENID: BUT NOW I'M ON THE LEGAL TRACK,
BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY'S OUT OF WHACK, AND ONLY WOMEN HAVE THE GUTS TO GO AND TAKE IT BACK.
WE'LL MAKE THE GOVERNMENT COME CLEAN, AND GET MORE PEOPLE VOTING GREEN,
AND REALLY STICK IT TO THE PHALLOCENTRIC WAR MACHINE.
ELLE: I love your top! It’s so fatigue chic. So how psyched are you guys? Our first day at Harvard Law.
Hi. I’m Ellle Woods. And this is Bruiser Woods.
ENID: Enid.
ELLE: Oh my god, we both have names that start with an E!
ENID: Oh my god, we're, like, practically twins!
EMMET: We’re just going around the circle…tell us something about yourself.
ELLE: Me? Okay. So I’m a Gemini with a double Capricorn moon and I have a Bachelors from UCLA where I
was president of Delta Nu Sorority. I was also Sig Ep Sweetheart and founded the charity Shop for a Cause.
EMMET: Huh.
ELLE: Oh! And just last week at Fred Segal, I talked Beyonce out of buying a truly heinous cable-knit tube top.
Whoever said tangerine is the new pink is seriously deranged.
EMMET: I did not know that.
ELLE: Anyone know where I can find Criminal Law 101 with Professor CALLAHAN? And Warner Huntington III?
EMMET: Well, we’re all heading there, so I’m sure someone would be happy to—…show you?
It’s in Hauser. Over there, second building on the left.
ELLE: Thanks.
EMMET: But I don’t think dogs are exactly allowed in class.
ELLE: Oh, Bruiser’s not a dog. Bruiser’s family. I’ll just drop him off at my room. He’d be happier there
anyway: Bruiser loves Days of Our Lives. I’ll see you later then.

WARNER: Elle?!
ELLE: Ohmigod, Warner! That’s so weird, I totally forgot you go here!
WARNER: What are you doing here?
ELLE: I go here.
WARNER: You got in to Harvard?
ELLE: What? Like it’s hard?
EMMET: I think this is yours. Woods, comma, Elle …
ELLE: Is this my social agenda?
EMMET: No, your academic roster.
ELLE: Right. There’s that. Let’s totally catch up after class.
EMMET: Who is she?
WARNER: My ex-girlfriend.


[BLANK] 
VIVIENNE: All that pink you’re wearing. Is that even legal?
ELLE: Pink’s my signature color.
VIVIENNE: So I gathered.
EMMET: Everyone take your seats. Callahan should be here any second.
Three years ago I was sitting right where you’re sitting and I’d heard the same rumors I’m sure you’ve
heard too. Callahan’s ruthless, he bathes in the blood of sheep, blahblahblah. Only partly true. What you
really need to know is --
CALLAHAN: —you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you.


[BLANK]
CALLAHAN: NOW WHEN YOU CHOOSE A LAW CAREER,
THE MOMENT YOU EMBARK
THERE IS THAT JOKE YOU’RE BOUND TO HEARSS
“A LAWYER IS A SHARK.”
IGNORE THAT. IT’S SIMPLISTIC AND IT’S DUMB.
ONLY SOME OF YOU WILL TURN OUT SHARKS, JUST SOME.
THE REST… ARE CHUM.
OUR TOPIC IS
BLOOD IN THE WATER.
KIDS, IT’S TIME YOU FACED:
LAW SCHOOL IS A WASTE --
OH YES. UNLESS YOU ACQUIRE A TASTE FOR
BLOOD IN THE WATER.
DARK AND RED AND RAW.
YOU’RE NOTHING UNTIL
THE THRILL OF THE KILL
BECOMES YOUR ONLY LAW.
Mr....Schultz, hypothetical question: Would you be willing to defend the following banker accused of
fraud...  A KIND OLD GRANDMA TOOK HER SAVINGS AND SHE SENT IT
OFF TO YOUR CLIENT. ALL SHE SAVED SINCE SHE WAS BORN.
WELL, HE PROMISED TO INVEST IT, BUT HE SPENT IT.
ON PROSTITUTES. AND HEROIN. AND PORN.
AARON: No. I wouldn’t want to take that case!
CALLAHAN: WRONG! THIS ONE IS A WIN, UNLESS YOU’RE LAZY.
GRANDMA’S BROKE! SHE’LL HAVE SOME HACK FROM LEGAL AID.
PUT HER ON THE STAND AND CALL HER OLD AND CRAZY;
YOUR GUY GOES FREE, AND HE CAN GET YOU HIGH AND LAID.
LOOK FOR THE BLOOD IN THE WATER.
READ YOUR THOMAS HOBBES:
ONLY SPINELESS SNOBS
WILL QUARREL WITH THE MORALLY DUBIOUS JOBS.
WITH BLOOD IN THE WATER,
YOUR SCRUPLES ARE A FLAW.
Ms...Hoopes, another hypothetical: would you be the right lawyer for the following client...?
SAY THEY OFFER YOU A BUNDLE FOR DEFENDING
A FAMOUS HIT MAN FOR THE MAFIA ELITE.
SEEMS HE MISSED HIS CHOSEN PREY,
KILLED A NUN AND DROVE AWAY,
RUNNING OVER THREE CUTE PUPPIES IN THE STREET.
ENID: What you think I wouldn’t defend him just because he’s a typical man?
CALLAHAN: Oh, you lesbians think you’re so tough.
OH DEAR, I FEAR MY COMMENT HAS OFFENDED.
...HARD TO ARGUE, THOUGH, WHEN YOU’RE TOO MAD TO SPEAK.
YOUR EMPLOYMENT WILL BE VERY QUICKLY ENDED
ONCE THEY SEE HOW YOUR EMOTIONS MAKE YOU WEAK.
SO WHAT’S MY POINT? I RUN A BILLION-DOLLAR LAW FIRM.
AND I HIRE FOUR NEW INTERNS EV’RY YEAR.
FROM THIS CLASS I WILL SELECT
FOUR YOUNG SHARKS WHOM I RESPECT,
AND THOSE FOUR WILL HAVE A GUARANTEED CAREER.
DO YOU FOLLOW ME?
SO I WANNA SEE…WHAT?
CLASS: BLOOD IN THE WATER?
CALLAHAN/STUDENTS:
EXACTLY.
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.                                MM…
FOUR OF YOU WILL WIN...                           MM…
BUT JUST THOSE FOUR                                 OO…OO…
WITH A DORSAL FIN.                                     OO…OO!
YES! BLOOD IN THE WATER.                        YES! BLOOD IN THE WATER
SO BITE AND SCRATCH AND                        AH AH AH AH AH AH
CLAW…                                                            AH!
CALLAHAN: Yes. Ms…?
ELLE: Woods, Elle Woods.
CALLAHAN: Someone’s had their morning coffee. Would you summarize the case of State of Indiana v. Hearne from your reading, please.
ELLE: Oh, I wanted to answer the puppy question.
CALLAHAN: But I’m asking you about the assigned reading.
ELLE: Okay, who assigns reading for the first day of class?
CALLAHAN: You have guts, Ms. Woods. Ms...Kensington...
LET US SAY YOU TEACH A CLASS AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL--
A POSITION THAT YOU’RE JUSTLY PROUD ABOUT.
BUT A GIRL ON WHOM YOU CALL
HASN’T READ THE CASE AT ALL.
SHOULD YOU LET IT GO, OR--
VIVIENNE: NO. I’D THROW HER OUT.
CALLAHAN/STUDENTS: …ALRIGHT THEN.
YOU HEARD YOUR CLASSMATE.                                      OOH…
YOU HAVE JUST BEEN KILLED.                                          OOH…
SHE CUT YOUR THROAT,
SO GRAB YOUR COAT,
YES, YOU’VE GOT GUTS                                                    OOH…OOH..
BUT NOW THEY’RE SPILLED!                                           BUT NOW THEY’RE SPILLED!
YOUR…BLOOD’S IN THE WATER                                     YOUR… BLOOD’S IN THE WATER,
SO WOULD YOU PLEASE                                                   HA HA HA
WITHDRAW?                                                                       HA HA HA HA!
AND IF YOU RETURN,
BE READY TO LEARN.
…OR IS THAT UNFAIR?
…OH WAIT: I DON’T CARE!
THAT’S JUST HOW I RULE                                                   OOH...
IN LIFE AS IN SCHOOL,
WITH FEAR AND SHOCK AND AWE!                                 OOH AH AH AWE!

your law career is NOT over.

EMMET: Yeah… come back tomorrow and make sure you’ve done your reading?…
ELLE: Okay. Excuse me, but why would you do that to another girl?
VIVIENNE: Do what?
ELLE: We girls have to stick together. We shouldn’t try to look good by making each other look bad.

PAULETTE: So what’s she got that you don’t got? Three tits?
ELLE: She’s “serious.”
PAULETTE: Seriously, she have three tits?
ELLE: No, she’s a constipated polo shirt with a mousy brown bob. Apparently that’s what Warner wants. So,
you have to make me a brunette.
PAULETTE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you know the number one reason behind all Bad Hair Decisions?

VIVIENNE: Definitely come. It’s a costume party.
ELLE: I love costume parties!
VIVIENNE: Of course you do… Next Friday at eight, 243 Mass Ave. See you there.
ELLE: Thanks, Vivenne.
PAULETTE: Oh, you are SO borrowin’ my secret weapon costume I got in storage, Elle, I’ll just dust off the
mothballs, and wait’ll you see it…. Now go and do this, honey. ‘Cause if a girl like you can’t win back
your man, there’s no hope for the rest of us.
ELLE: Thanks Paulette! You have no idea how much I needed this!
PAULETTE: Now you go and fight for him.

VIVIENNE: Whitney, darling!  Thank you for hosting this.
WHITNEY: My pleasure.
VIVIENNE: We all needed a break from law school anxieties and worrying about Callahan’s internship.
WHITNEY: You can say that again. Please enjoy yourselves, mingle.
VIVIENNE: You do know that Whitney’s father is next in line to be the Speaker of the House?
WARNER: So you’ve said.
VIVIENNE: Just think of it: Future presidents may be in this very room.
VIVIENNE: I’m going to track down Robert Coleman and convince him he must join our study group. Apparently his summer house is three houses down from Justice Souter.
WARNER: Great. I’m gonna go get a beer.
HARVARD STUDENT: Whoa. Check out Miss October.
WHITNEY: Oh my god.
ELLE: Hi, stranger.
WARNER: ELLE: ! Man!...What’s with the costume?
ELLE: Can’t a girl shake things up?
WARNER: Yeah but why couldn’t you have worn this when we were going out?
ELLE: Because I guess you never asked
WARNER: Which will now rank as the greatest regret of my entire life.
I still can’t get over the fact you’re here at Harvard... Back at U.C.L.A. I never would’ve guessed it.
Sometimes I miss the old days...
WARNER: THOSE PARTIES SENIOR YEAR...I THOUGHT WE RULED THE WORLD.
ELLE: YOU FUNNELED ALL THAT BEER I HELD YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU HURLED.
WARNER: WE WERE LIKE GODS BACK THEN! WALKING AMONG COMMON MEN.
TELL ME WHY CAN’T IT BE THAT WAY AGAIN?
ELLE: DREAMS DON’T JUST DISAPPEAR
WE COULD KEEP ON DREAMING THEM HERE!
WARNER: …What?
ELLE: LIKE SENIOR YEAR… BUT FUNNER!
YOU’VE GOT YOUR FUTURE ALL PLANNED.
WARNER: YES I DO, GUESS I DO…
ELLE: WHAT IF I’M STANDING THERE TOO?
WARNER: WAIT, I’M NOT FOLLOWING YOU…
ELLE: I’M HERE ‘CAUSE I UNDERSTAND…
WARNER: NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND…
ELLE: I’M HERE ‘CAUSE I’M SERIOUS!
WARNER: YEAH, RIGHT, YOU LOOK REAL SERIOUS.
ELLE: Warner, don’t forget I got into this school, too. And now we’re here together, studying law. Maybe we’ll
both get Callahan’s internship and work together...
WARNER: Whoa. Wait a second. Elle . You get kicked out of class, like, every day. You don’t ACTUALLY
believe you have a chance of getting the internship?
ELLE: Of course?
WARNER: Everyone in the class wants it; nobody more than me. It’s a guaranteed career. You’re practically partner before you have a job offer.
VIVIENNE: ELLE: . You’re looking...fluffy. As usual.
ELLE: Hello, Vivienne. Thanks for your great tip on the “costume party.” 
I see you came as Last Year’s Sample Sale.
WARNER: Pooh B- Elle, ... You have to ace his course to get that internship and he’s not called “C-Minus Callahan”
for nothing.
ELLE: Warner, I'm completely cognizant of both those facts.
VIVIENNE: You're not going to make it through the semester, let alone get Callahan's internship.
Even if you keep going... and going... and going...
Face it, bunny One of these things is not like the other.
Someday, we’ll nominate Supreme Court justices… And you’ll… tan.
Run home, Elle, and change out of your skank costume.
ELLE: Oh is THAT what you see, Vivienne? How unfortunate.
Because I am Gloria Steinem undercover, circa 1963, researching for her feminist manifesto 'I Was a
Playboy Bunny.' Are you actually calling Gloria Steinem a SKANK?
ENID: Who’s calling Gloria Steinem a skank?
ELLE: She is!
[BLANK]
EMMET: Whoa, Elle ... What’s up, Doc?
ELLE: LOVE.
EMMET: ‘Scuse me?
ELLE: I PUT MY FAITH IN LOVE. I FOLLOWED WHERE IT LED…
EMMET: Love led you here?
ELLE: …TO MY PERSONAL CIRCLE OF HELL.
IT HAS NOT WORKED OUT WELL.
I WISH THAT I WERE DEAD.
‘CAUSE INSTEAD OF A WEDDING
AND LOVE,
I’M FLUNKING OUT OF SCHOOL,
A TOTAL LAUGHINGSTOCK;
SOMEONE HE AND HIS FRIENDS CAN JUST…MOCK!
SO, GO ON, HERE’S MY HEAD
JUST HIT IT WITH A ROCK..!
EMMET: Wait. Go back.
YOU CAME OUT HERE TO FOLLOW A MAN?
HARVARD LAW WAS JUST PART OF THAT “PLAN”?
MAN, WHAT RICH ROMANTIC PLANET ARE YOU FROM?
ELLE: Malibu?
EMMET: INSTEAD OF LYING OUTSIDE BY THE POOL,
YOU STALK SOME GUY TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL?
THAT’S THE WEIRDEST REASON I-
ELLE: Well, why'd you come?
EMMET: OKAY
I GREW UP IN THE ROXBURY SLUMS.
WITH MY MOM AND A SERIES OF BUMS.
GUYS WHO SHOWED ME ALL THE WAYS A MAN CAN FAIL.
I GOT THROUGH LAW SCHOOL BY BUSTING MY ASS;
WORKED TWO JOBS, IN ADDITION TO CLASS.
SO FORGIVE ME FOR NOT WEEPING AT YOUR TALE.
ELLE: Excuse me! Just because you’ve got some kind of chip on your shoulder…
EMMET: You know what? That’s right.
THERE’S A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER,
AND IT’S BIG AS A BOULDER.
WITH THE CHANCE I’VE BEEN GIVEN,
I GOTTA BE DRIVEN AS HELL!
I’M SO CLOSE I CAN TASTE IT,
SO I’M NOT GONNA WASTE IT.
YEAH, THERE’S A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER…
YOU MIGHT WANNA GET ONE AS WELL.
ELLE: I’m sorry, but that sounds highly negative.
EMMET: Hey, I’m just being honest. When you weren’t born into privilege, you gotta work twice as hard. And I want my sweatshirt back.
ELLE: Wait! Two jobs plus law school?
EMMET: I haven't slept since 2008
ELLE: Seriously, how did you do it?
EMMET: WELL, I DON’T GO TO PARTIES A LOT.
NOT GOOD USE OF THE TIME THAT I’VE GOT.
CAN’T SPEND HOURS DOIN’ MY HAIR OR STAYN’ IN SHAPE.
ELLE: I don’t spend hours…

Define Malum prohibitum.
ELLE: “Malum prohibitum” is …
EMMET: An act prohibited by…
ELLE: Prohibited by law! Like jaywalking! Or chewing gum in Singapore.
EMMET: Therefore “Malum in se” means:
ELLE: An action that’s… evil in itself! Assault, murder, white shoes after Labor Day…
EMMET: Good.  Where you going?
ELLE: Home, of course. Thanksgiving break, remember?

WARNER: Mr. Lattimer wasn’t stalking. He was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation… Russell v. Sullivan.
CALLAHAN: But Russell was known to the mother. Lattimer was an anonymous donor.
WARNER: Well yeah, but without Mr. Lattimer’s sperm, the child in question wouldn’t exist.
CALLAHAN: Now you’re thinking like a lawyer.
CALLAHAN: Yes, Ms. Woods?
ELLE: Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, but did the defendant keep a log of every sperm emission made
throughout his life?
CALLAHAN: Interesting. Why do you ask?
ELLE: Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every sexual encounter to find if a child resulted from
those unions, he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever. Why now, why this sperm?
CALLAHAN: I see your point.
ELLE: …And by Mr. Huntington’s standard, all masturbatory emissions where the sperm was clearly not
seeking an egg could be called reckless abandonment.
CALLAHAN: Ms. Woods, you just won your case.
ELLE: OH MY GOD…

PAULETTE: I don’t know, Elle. Dewey scares the crap outta me.

DEWEY: Now what?
ELLE: Mr.... Dewey, we are Ms. Buonofuonte's legal team.
DEWEY: Lawyers?
ELLE: I don't think you understand that the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts recognizes your 10-year
relationship with Ms. Buonofuonte as a Common Law marriage, which entitles her to equitable division
of property.
DEWEY: Huh?
ELLE: Translation,

GUARD: Wyndham! You got some visitors!
EMMET: Hi, Ms. Wyndham. I’m Emmet Forest. I’m co-counsel with Stidwell, Zyskowski, Fox and Callahan .
These four interns are the cream of the crop at Harvard Law and we’re here to “whip up” your legal
defense.
[BLANK]
EMMET: Incidentally, my mom’s a big fan of your DVDs. Credits you with her nutcracker butt. Her words.
[BLANK]
EMMET: Anywho, we’d love to discuss your case and go over a few choices. We want to free you as soon as
possible, so you can bring your message back to your fans.
BROOKE: That’s all I want… This should be easy.
EMMET: Great. Callahan briefed me on your meeting and there is a significant amount of evidence against you. To free you, the jury will need to hear an alibi.
BROOKE: Not gonna happen.
EMMET: Even though it could save you?
BROOKE: Yep. Put me on the stand and I’ll be forced to lie.
WARNER: Okay Ms. Wyndham, if we can’t hear an alibi, you should accept a plea bargain.
BROOKE: And admit to something I didn’t do?
VIVIENNE: But with a plea bargain, you’d get out in a couple of years. That sounds reasonable, right?
BROOKE: Reasonable to do time for my husband’s killer? Not really.
ENID: Oh, she’s tough.    Yo! Sister –
BROOKE: Yo! Not related!
I need a defense team who knows I’m innocent. Get out of here. All of you. Guard!
[BLANK]
ELLE: “WHO WHO IS THE GIRL WITH LOYAL FRIENDS AND TRUE?
BROOKE: WHO WHO?
ELLE: WHO WHO HAS A BOND AS STRONG AS KRAZY GLUE?
BROOKE: WHO WHO?
ELLE: WHO CAN SOUND THE CALL AND SISTERS ALL COME THROUGH?
BROOKE/ELLE: 
WHO? 
WHO? 
DELTA NU NU NU!
DELTA NU NU NU!
YOU ARE A DELTA NU!
DELTA NU NU NU!
DELTA NU NU NU!
YOU ARE A DELTA NU!”
ELLE: Delta Nu’s former U.C.L.A. President Elle Woods! I knew I recognized your mug shot!
BROOKE: Shut up!
ELLE: Oh yeah! Your DVD’s got me in shape to be June for the Girls of U.C.L.A. calendar!
BROOKE: That’s so great! Thank god someone on this team gets me!
ELLE: Sisterhood’s forever. I believe you. And I will fight with everything I have to clear your good name.
But that involves an alibi…
BROOKE: I can’t tell it.
ELLE: Everyone has their secrets. For years I denied my highlights.
BROOKE: It’s beyond highlights, Elle. It’s a disgrace. My secret is nuclear and if it gets out, I could lose my fitness
empire. It means everything to me. If I tell you...will you Delta Nu Sister Swear not to tell anyone?
ELLE: I will Double Delta Nu Sister Swear.
BROOKE: You’re hard-core. Okay. On the day my husband was killed, I had…Ljhdsg…
ELLE: What?...
BROOKE: Liposhffb…
ELLE: Brooke, you’re going to have to speak up, I can’t –
BROOKE: LIPOSUCTION! MINIMALLY INVASIVE, OUTPATIENT LIPO, BUT LIPO!
ELLE: Oh, my god!
PRISON GUARD: Ms. Wyndham, your time is up.
BROOKE: I had to do it. Serious cottage cheese was showing up on MY ass!
ELLE: Your secret’s safe with me.
BROOKE: I can’t lose my fitness empire! I’d rather rot in jail! You gotta take care of me, ELLE.  You swore.
[BLANK] 
EMMET: Elle, there you are.
CALLAHAN: Where’s Brooke?
ELLE: The guard took her back.
CALLAHAN: Great…
ELLE: But I got her alibi.
CALLAHAN: You’re kidding.
So. What is it?
ELLE: I’m afraid I can’t tell you.
CALLAHAN: Why not?
ELLE: I Double Delta Nu Sister swore not to.
VIVIENNE: Elle, this is not some little sorority thing…
ELLE: Oh, I know. It’s a big sorority thing. But don’t worry Brooke really had nothing to do with this.
Look, Brooke’s a fitness queen. Exercise gives you endorphins, and endorphins make you happy – think
about it. Happy people just don’t kill!
[BLANK] 
CALLAHAN: Emmet, a word.        
VIVIENNE: Elle, are you serious? If you don’t give up this alibi, we will ALL lose the case.
ELLE: Then I guess we’re not very good lawyers.
WARNER: Will you stop being a Marilyn, Elle? Listen, Pooh Bear – Elle, Callahan wants that alibi. Give it to him
and you can sail through law school, knowing there’s a big fat job offer waiting for you when you get out.
ELLE: But I gave Brooke my word.
WARNER: So what, who cares?
ELLE: Who cares?
[BLANK]
CALLAHAN: Emmet, let me be very clear. This is your chance, and I gave you simple instructions — Lead this legal
team and get me an alibi. You’re zero for two.
Everyone, field trip’s over. Let’s go. Back to work.
Except you two. I’d rather not see ratty corduroy and Legally Blonde again today.
[BLANK]
ELLE: Emmet, I’m sorry –
EMMET: I don’t need you to be sorry. I need you to tell me the alibi.
ELLE: I can’t because I gave Brooke my word. Having an alibi isn’t the only way to win this case.
EMMET: No, but it sure would help.
ELLE: Work with me. We’ll free Brooke the right way. The noble way.
EMMET: This isn’t a Lifetime Original Movie, Elle. I’m not interested in nobility right now, I’m more interested in
saving Brooke’s life.
ELLE: No you’re not. You’re more interested in impressing Callahan .
EMMET: Well, he IS my boss. And if I impress him he’ll make me associate.
ELLE: And jeopardize your client’s trust and our integrity?
EMMET: Well, when you put it that way.
ELLE: Exactly, you butthead. My word means something, I know yours does too.
EMMET: I haven't been called butthead since the third grade
ELLE: Maybe not to your face. C’mon, let’s get out of here.
[BLANK]
EMMET: Why do you always have to be right?
ELLE: I don’t have to be… when I’m with you, I just am. Hey, if you want to impress Callahan , I can help.
EMMET: Okay. How?
ELLE: Listen, I love your scruffy vibe, but “Casual Friday” is so not in Callahan’s vocabulary, and you have to
dress the part if you want to get ahead.
EMMET: Elle, didn’t your mother ever teach you about not judging a book by its cover?
ELLE: She did. And books with tattered covers stay on the shelf.
EMMET: Thanks a lot.
ELLE:  Emmet, this isn’t a perfect world. Think people haven’t judged me my whole life? Think it wasn’t a
good idea to make navy my new pink?
EMMET: No, that was a good idea.
ELLE: I know.
EMMET: Where are we going exactly?
ELLE: You trust me, don’t you?
EMMET: Of course.
ELLE: Then don’t stop now.
[BLANK] 
EMMET: What is this place?
ELLE: It’s called a department store.
EMMET: It’s…it’s beautiful.
ELLE: Shhhhhh…
FIRST, A DEEP BREATH.
TAKE IT ALL IN.
FEEL ALL THOSE HALOGENS
WARMING YOUR SKIN.
SMELL HOW THEY PUMP IN PURE OXYGEN?
SEE, THEY CARE.
H&H SALESGIRL: Love?
EMMET: Excuse me?
H&H SALESGIRL: “Love,” The new fragrance from Chanel.
EMMET: Oh… No thank you…
ELLE: I KNOW YOU’RE SCARED,
NEVERTHELESS,
THINK OF THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO IMPRESS.
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE FOR ME. JUST NOD YES,
AND PREPARE…
THERE’S SOMETHING IN THE AIR!
EMMET: I think it’s “Love”.

gavels on ‘em for ya?
ELLE: It’s okay, Paulette. That might be a bit too much.
PAULETTE: Classy lawyer pink it is. When the jury people see those nails, they’ll know they can trust ya.
ELLE: Which is more than my team is doing. They’re all over me to give up Brooke’s alibi.
PAULETTE: Including your  “friend” Emmet?
ELLE: Well… he IS on the team too…

SERENA: When your Bend and Snap has that much snap, it’s been known to alter all laws of physics and logic.
PAULETTE: What are you talking about...Bend and Snap...?
ELLE: The Bend...and Snap!
It’s a move invented by U.C.L.A. cheerleaders to break the will of the opposing team.
But it also has real world applications: the Bend and Snap is 99.99% effective on straight men.
PAULETTE: Yeah, and I’ve got a great track record with those.

PAULETTE: Cheerleaders scare me!

TV REPORTER: In day three of the Brooke Wyndham murder trial, D.A. Joyce Riley has been grilling Nikos Argitakos, Miss Wyndham’s pool boy, all morning. The waters could get dicey, let’s hope the defense packed their floaties…Kaite.
DA JOYCE RILEY: ...which is why you should clarify for the court exactly what your duties were as pool boy.
NIKOS: Cleaning the pool.
DA JOYCE RILE: So, Mr. Argitakos, could you explain what Exhibit A is?
NIKOS: That was my uniform.
DA JOYCE RILEY: Was it Brooke’s idea to have you wear this “uniform?”
NIKOS: Ya
DA JOYCE RILEY: And could you please tell the court exactly what your relationship was to the defendant?
NIKOS: Brooke and I were LOVERS.
DA JOYCE RILEY: No further questions.
CALLAHAN: He was your lover?
BROOKE: Oh no. A Delta Nu would never sleep with a man in a thong! I just liked to watch him clean the filters…
CALLAHAN: Unbelievable! You’re all making me look like an ass up there!
Your honor! I request a 10-minute recess!
ELLE: Excuse me. I’ll take this outside.
CALLAHAN: Why didn’t I know about this disaster?!
EMMET: Alright, it is a set-back…
CALLAHAN: It’s motive, Emmet.
ELLE: Paullette, what’s up?
PAULETTE: Elle, I just had to call and thank ya! The bend and snap worked! I may-a broke Kyle's nose,
but I got to spend four and a half hours with him in the ambulance and ER!
It was the most romantic time I everhad in my whole life!
ELLE: Paulette, that’s so great! I told you the Bend and Snap is infallible unless the guy is gay or someth-
Ohmigod. I’ve gotta go. Bye.
PAULETTE: Bye.

ELLE: Watch this!....Did you see it?
CALLAHAN: See what?
WARNER: Maybe you should do it one more time.
ENID: Please!
ELLE: Nikos couldn’t have had the affair with Brooke! I just did the Bend and Snap in front of him and nothing.
Clearly he must be gay.
BROOKE: Nikos did leave a Cher CD in the pool house once…
WARNER: You want to out this guy on the stand? Elle, that’s crazy. You can’t build a legal strategy on the… Bend
and Snap. We need a defense, not a dance move.
CALLAHAN: So you think he’s perjured himself. But you can’t prove it. 
If you’re not right, we look desperate AND homophobic. 
VIVIENNE: But if she’s right…
ELLE: And I know I am!
ELLE: THERE!
RIGHT THERE!  -- LOOK AT THAT TAN, WELL-TENDED SKIN!
LOOK AT THE KILLER SHAPE HE’S IN!
LOOK AT HIS SLIGHTLY STUBBLY CHIN!
OH PLEASE, HE’S GAY,
TOTALLY GAY!
CALLAHAN: I’M NOT ABOUT TO CELEBRATE
EVERY TRAIT COULD INDICATE
A TOTALLY STRAIGHT EXPATRIATE.
THIS GUY’S NOT GAY.  I SAY NOT GAY.
DEFENSE TEAM: THAT IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.
WELL IS IT RELEVANT TO ASSUME
THAT A MAN WHO WEARS PERFUME
IS AUTOMATICALLY RADICALLY FEY?
EMMET: BUT LOOK AT HIS COIFFED AND CRISPY LOCKS!
ELLE: LOOK AT HIS SILK TRANSLUCENT SOCKS!
CALLAHAN: THERE’S THE ETERNAL PARADOX

VIVIENNE: WHAT ARE WE SEEIN’?
CALLAHAN: IS HE GAY…
ELLE: OF COURSE HE’S GAY!
CALLAHAN: …OR EUROPEAN!
DEFENSE TEAM: OHHHH…
GAY OR EUROPEAN?
IT’S HARD TO GUARANTEE;
IS HE GAY OR EUROPEAN?
WARNER: WELL HEY, DON’T LOOK AT ME…
VIVIENNE: YOU SEE THEY BRING THEIR BOYS UP DIFF’RENT
IN THOSE CHARMING FOREIGN PORTS;
THEY PLAY PECULIAR SPORTS,
DEFENSE TEAM: IN SHINY SHIRTS AND TINY SHORTS.
GAY OR FOREIGN FELLA?
THE ANSWER COULD TAKE WEEKS!
THEY BOTH SAY THINGS LIKE “CIAO BELLA”
WHILE THEY KISS YOU ON BOTH CHEEKS!
ELLE: OH PLEASE.
DEFENSE TEAM: GAY OR EUROPEAN?
SO MANY SHADES OF GRAY.
WARNER: DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF DAY.

IS HE GAY OR EUROPEAN,   OR…
ENID: THERE! RIGHT THERE!
LOOK AT THAT CONDESCENDING SMIRK!
SEEN IT ON EVERY GUY AT WORK!
THAT IS A METRO HET’RO JERK.
THIS GUY’S NOT GAY.
I SAY NO WAY.
ALL: THAT IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM! WELL IS IT RELEVANT TO PRESUME. THAT A HOTTIE IN THAT COSTUME
VIVIENNE: IS AUTOMATICALLY RADICALLY…

WARNER: GENETICALLY MEDICALLY…
ALL: GAY! OFFICIALLY GAY!
SWISHILY GAY GAY GAY GAY…

CALLAHAN: SO STYLISH AND RELAXED.

CALLAHAN: I THINK HIS CHEST IS WAXED.
VIVIENNE: BUT THEY BRING THEIR BOYS UP DIFFERENT THERE;
IT’S CULTUR’LLY DIVERSE.  IT’S NOT A FASHION CURSE
ALL: IF HE WEARS A KILT OR BEARS A PURSE!  
ELLE: GAY OR JUST EXOTIC?  I STILL CAN’T CRACK THE CODE!
BROOKE: YEAH, HIS ACCENT IS HYPNOTIC BUT HIS SHOES ARE POINTY-TOED.
ALL:  HUH.  GAY OR EUROPEAN?
SO MANY SHADES OF GREY!

EMMET: WAIT A MINUTE!
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO CRACK THIS GUY. I’VE AN IDEA I’D LIKE TO TRY.
CALLAHAN: The floor is yours.
EMMET: So Mr. Argitakos, this alleged affair with Mrs. Wyndham has been going on for…?
NIKOS: Two years.
EMMET: And your first name again is…?
NIKOS: Nikos. 
EMMET: And your boyfriend’s name is…?
NIKOS: Carlos.
Sorry, I misunderstand. You say “boyfriend.” I thought you say “best friend.” Carlos is my “best” friend.
CARLOS: You bastard! You lying bastard! That’s it! I no cover for you no more! Peoples! I have big
announcement!
THIS MAN IS GAY AND EUROPEAN! AND NEITHER IS DISGRACE!
YOU GOTTA STOP YOUR BEIN’ A COMPLETELY CLOSET CASE!

CALLAHAN: For decisively turning the case around and for nailing the pool boy.
WARNER: Emmet nailed the pool boy.
EMMET: Well... I have to share this victory with Elle.
ENID: To Emmet and -- I can’t believe I’m saying this -- to Elle.
ALL: To Elle!
WARNER: Yeah… since when did finely-tuned gay-dar qualify as a legal victory?
CALLAHAN: But without that “gay-dar,” we wouldn’t be celebrating with champagne, we’d be dead in the water. Elle Woods trusts her gut and has shown more legal smarts than most on my staff. She won this round,
making her a good lawyer. And while we’d still love to hear that alibi she got, by keeping it, she’s never
compromised the client’s trust, making her a great one. Which is more than I can say about you, Warner. 
Be useful. Go get me a coffee.
WARNER: But we’re drinking champagne?...
CALLAHAN: Splenda and skim. Everyone else, please go home and get a good night’s sleep. I need you all sharp tomorrow morning.
CALLAHAN: Ms. Woods, could I have a word?
ELLE: Of course. I’ll catch up with you in a second.
And thank you, Professor Callahan, for what you said before. It meant a lot.
CALLAHAN: You deserved it. But don’t tell the other law students I said so. I have a scary reputation to uphold.
ELLE: Don’t worry: your secret’s safe with me.
But I really appreciate this opportunity to work with you. I’ve learned so much…
CALLAHAN: What you’ve learned isn’t the point. You’ve got instincts. And instincts, legal or otherwise, can’t be
taught. Trust your instincts.
CALLAHAN: I thought you were smarter than that.
ELLE: Is this the only reason why you gave me an internship?
CALLAHAN: It’s been nice working with you, Ms. Woods. You can show yourself out.
WARNER: Well, hel-lo Marilyln! Looks like you’ll make partner now. You’ve really earned it.
VIVIENNE: Warner, shut up!

CHUTNEY: I was out getting a perm.
ELLE: And then you came home and took a shower?
CHUTNEY: YES. I was in the shower

ELLE: Thank you. Now, Ms. Wyndham, you claim on the day of the murder, you got a perm. Was this your
first perm?
CHUTNEY: No. I’ve permed my hair since junior high, about three a year. 
ELLE: Interesting. My associate has just gotten a perm herself today. Exhibit B: Ms. Enid Hoopes.
Thank you, Ms. Buonfonte. Now Ms. Wyndham, would Exhibit B’s perm be similar to your own?
CHUTNEY: Duh.
ELLE: And now, one more time, you didn’t see the murder or hear the gunshot because you were where?...
ALL: In the shower!!!!
ELLE: Thank you. Ms. Hoopes, would you step into the shower, please?

CHUTNEY: Idiot. You can’t get a perm wet for 48 hour –
ELLE: Exactly! Water deactivates the perm’s ammonium thiglycolate and completely ruins it. It’s the cardinal
rule of perm maintenance. Your perm is still intact so you couldn’t have showered that day. Why would
you lie about being in the shower?
CHUTNEY: I was --
ELLE: Why would you lie about NOT hearing the gunshot?
CHUTNEY: But I –

Thou cans’t not then be false to any man.” I believe this wise statement best applies to a woman. A
